School Performance Analysis
Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of school performance data, focusing on various metrics such as budget, average scores, and passing rates for both math and reading across different schools. The analysis aims to identify patterns and insights that can inform strategies for improving academic outcomes.

Objectives
To provide a summary of the school district's overall performance.
To give detailed performance metrics for individual schools.
To identify the highest and lowest performing schools.
To analyze performance variations by grade, school spending, school size, and school type.
Files Included
school_performance_analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis and visualizations.
data/: A folder containing the dataset used for the analysis.
Analysis Steps
District Summary: Calculated total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and overall passing rates for the entire district.
School Summary: Provided detailed metrics for each school, including total students, budget per student, average scores, and passing rates.
Performance Comparison: Identified the top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rates.
Scores by Grade: Analyzed average math and reading scores across different grades (9th to 12th).
Scores by School Spending: Examined how spending per student impacts academic performance.
Scores by School Size: Analyzed performance based on the size of the student body.
Scores by School Type: Compared performance metrics between different types of schools (e.g., charter vs. public).
Key Findings
Impact of Spending on Performance:
Higher spending per student is associated with better academic performance, as seen in higher average scores and passing rates in the highest spending bracket.
Performance Variation by School Size:
Smaller schools tend to have higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools, potentially due to more individualized attention and support.
